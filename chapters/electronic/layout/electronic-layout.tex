\section{PCB Layout}
Now, we can start the layout process, in this order :

\begin{itemize}
    \item   Place the remaining components on the board
    \item   Route sensibles tracks.
    \item   Route the remaining tracks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component placement}
Our board is quite big for the components we needed to place. Thus, there is some empty spaces,
which is not a bad thing.

This also mean that the placement of passives (which are, for most in the package size 0603) was
easier, since circuits are physically distants from others.

For each circuits, we always start with the decoupling capacitors, that need to be carrefully
placed near each power pins of the circuits. Then, we place the remaining passives that can
be placed farther from the chip, for example pull up resistors.

This whole process was iterated two times. On the first pass, we globally place the components,
within 2 or 3 mm of their final position. Once the whole board was done, we've got a first idea
of what the board was going to look, but there were a lot of smaller optimization that could be
done. That's the goal of the second pass, we replace every component to a place that can be easier
to route, aligned with the grid.

\subsection{Pin swapping}
For the next step, we configured the "pin swapping" function on the schematic, to enable some pins
to be swapped. This is possible due to the architecture of most recent microcontrollers, where all
of the functions goes trough a pin matrix to assign to a pin, regardless of the peripheral. This
gave us freedom on the crossing that can be deleted with it \footnote{
    This pin swapping method caused us some problems, because of an undocumented limitations : A
    peripheral can't use, at the same time multiples pins from different ports. This required
    us to re-route some part of the PCB.
}.
We created four groups of pins :
\begin{itemize}
    \item   A digital group on the port where the function is pinned to the port 0.
    \item   Another digital group, for the port 1.
    \item   An analog input group.
    \item   A global group, for independant pins that can be used on any port.
\end{itemize}

Then, the ECAD tool enable us to automatically perform pin swapping to globally optimize the pins.
Then, when routing, we can perform some precision pin swaps if it make the layout easier.

\subsection{Layout}
When routing the connections, we've always got in mind the signal integrity issues than can come
from mistakes at this point.
Thus, we make sure that any fast signal \footnote{
    In fast, near every signal on the board can be qualified as fast, due to their rising and falling
    edges. Nonetheless, for signals that enable or disable functions once in the flight, we assumed
    that their behavior when switching aren't going to perturb the overall execution.
} is routed on top layers, or, by default with a ground plane near it to act as a return path for the
currents and a reference.

For every signals, if they need to "cross" a signal, on another layer, we ensured the crossing to be
at a 90 degrees to reduce the crosstalk between them. In the same manner, we ensured that tracks that
are sensible won't couple inductively. This is done by separating them with enough space \footnote{A
    General rule of thumb is the 3W rule. Track center to the next center, there shall be 3 times the
    width.}

For every track, we needed to route with a correct width, to ensure the current carying capacity will
large enough. Thus, for power tracks such as the 5V rail for the servo engines, or the engines starter,
we respectively used 1.5mm wide tracks. For the 3.3V rail, that power up all of the logic, the current
is smaller, a 1mm wide track is more than enough.

To be added, where there where a lot of pads of the same net to connect together, we used planes rather
than tracks. This greatly increase the current capacity of this area, for a null cost.

To place tracks in a cleaner way, we divide by two the grid, enabling us the ability to pass exactly
in the middle of two pins, to arrive right to the center of a pad.

All of this work is shown on the images below, where we can see each layer, individually, with the
standard Altium color code.

As explained before, we can cleary see that the first (L1) and last (L4) layers
are the most filled with tracks. The second layer (L2) is effectively empty of
traces, to let the space for a whole ground plane, and, on the last layer there
is the mix of both.

Once the layout was finished, we did some more steps to make the PCB cleaner :

\begin{itemize}
    \item   Spacing tracks that can be spaced
    \item   Placing the silkscreen designators and logos on the PC\footnote{
              We ensured that designators were placed in two precise directions :
              Facing bottom of the board, or facing right side. This ensure some
              consistency in the overall design.
          }
    \item   Adding silkscreen notes to identify important pads.
\end{itemize}

Naturally, we runned a DRC (Design rules check) to ensure the PCB was correct, before
exporting it to the manufacturer.
