\section{PCB Requirements}
Before any layout step, we defined different specifications that need to be followed.

\subsection{PCB Stackup}
Since we used high frequency signals for the Bluetooth and the GPS antenna, as well as
some high speed digital signals (SPI), to ensure their signal integrity as well as a
maximal power transfer, we needed to match the impedances of the tracks to 50 Ohms.

To ensure this criterion will be respected, we needed the selection of a specific stackup.

This stackup took in considerations some parameters :
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Impedance of signals.
    \item   Design rules (width and tolerances).
    \item   Manufacturer abilities
\end{itemize}

We end up on the JLC04101H-3313 stackup, which is generally available for orders. This is a four
layer PCB, because that's much easier to make great routing on it, while maintaining costs low
enough. This one is defined as following :

\input{\Tables/stackup.tex}

On this stackup, we defined for each layer a precise role.
The top (L1) and bottom (L4) layers are used for general trace routings, where the second
layer (L2) is used as a ground plane, that is used as reference for impedance matched
signals, and to provide shielding between top and bottom layers.

Thus, high speed signals are routed on top layer (L1) to be nearer of the reference plane, and
where return current can be the closed to the forward path.
On the opposite side, there's the slower signals, that won't suffer from a further ground plane.

The last layer, (L3), is a plane that was at first designed to be another ground plane, with the
power delivery network (PDN) on it, routed with wide traces. Since it was too difficult to
properly route the signal out of the microcontroller, we're forced to add some signals traces too.
To ensure signal integrity, as well as the bottom (L4) layer, we didn't routed fast signals here.

\subsection{Board Shape}
The next parameter to be accounted before starting the layout is the board shape. Since
we're in a size constrained situation, we defined the board shape when designing the
mechanical support.

This gave us a board shape like that :

    \includegraphics[width=\SmallSchematicWidth]{\Images/PCB/shape.eps}
    \caption{Board outlines}\label{img:board_shape}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

In green, and with right angles, there the exported shape from the mechanical conception.
We defined a bit smaller board shape than that, to ensure that the manufacturing tolerances
wont cause any issues, and to add some margin. This final board shape \ref{img:board_shape}
is not clearly visible on the image, as it's drawn in grey and on a thin line.

There's a lot of mechanical support, by both screws and cuts to ensure the board can't be
mounted backward. This is required to ensure the positing system has always the same
reference position.

And, to finish, there some cutouts on the left side, to let more space for wirings. Thus, we
can easily make wires runs from the engines to the board without stressing them.

\subsection{Floorplan}
From all of theses settings, we can establish a first floorplan. As there is some cutouts for
wires on the board, the position of some connectors / soldering pads need to be defined, to
ensure the wire won't need to cross the board !
But there a lot of others elements with a defined position, theses includes :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   Antennas and related ICs / passives (need to be closest to the source, with excellent
          grounding)
    \item   Position of the accelerometers and IMU (Shall be placed near to the center of the board
          to prevent from rotationals events)
    \item   Position of the screws (Defined by the support)
\end{itemize}
