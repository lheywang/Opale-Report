\section{Digital part}
For the last part, the digital one, we didn't needed a lot of reflexion. Most of
the design was already done on development kits, for example on the nRF5340DK
\cite{nRF5340DK}. Even for sensors, there is mostly the default
application example that need to be copied, and slightly adapted to our needs.

For example, the modifications we done :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   Change configuration bootstrap to select one mode of the other.
    \item   Configure power supplies needed.
    \item   Configure I2C addresses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pin attribution}
When a sensor need to be connected on the MCU, we attribute some pins. Since near
all of them are digitals, and then be swapped by software. Thus, we'll be using a
pin swapping functionnality in Altium to perform theses operations for us.

Thus, the pin attribution on the MCU is quite arbitrary since it will change by after.
