\section{Digital part}
For this second part, the digital one we're going to look at the
microcontroller mostly, but also some parts of the whole digital subsystems.
For this part, we mostly got inspired by development kits, such as
\cite{nRF5340DK}. These provide a great example on how to implement some IC on
custom PCBs.

Around the MCU, we added some peripherals IC to fulfill our needs, for examples
:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item An 16 Mb EEPROM, to store flight measurements.
    \item An RGB LED, to indicate status to the user.
\end{itemize}

To ensure the systems are working we sometimes need to modify some elements
from the examples. These changes are always documented in the datsheets of the
components.

Here some examples of things we changed :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   Change configuration bootstrap to select one mode of the other.
    \item   Configure power supplies needed.
    \item   Configure I2C addresses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pin attribution}
To understand how we assigned to each functions some pins on the MCU, we need
to read the datasheets, mainly the MCU one. It's clearly explained that any
peripheral can be routed to any pins a pin matrix . Nonetheless, there's some
pins that can designed for a specific function. For example, there is two pins
designed for high drain current, where the opposite direction (pull up) is
standard. These pins are designed to handle high speed I2C ! So if we want to
use fast I2C, it's clearly recommended to use them.

The remaining pins were placed arbitrary, because we'll changed that later !
\ref{sec:pin_swap}.

\subsection{Discrete logic}\label{subsec:dis_logic}
On the board, most of the logic is done in software by the MCU. But there's two
hardware functions, related to security features.

These are latching the state of the pin with a DLATCH on the boot of the board,
and an AND gate between the command of the engines and input of the drivers.

This enable us to block the start of engines in hardware rather than by
software only. Thus, if the board is configured as debug mode, it won't be able
to start engines, regardless of the software loaded.
