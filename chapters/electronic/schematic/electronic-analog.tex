\section{Analog conception}
Now, let's jump into the analog design we've done : There isn't many analog
circuitery on this board, and we only use it for two purposes :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   Get the position feedback of the servos.
    \item   Monitor voltages on power rails.
\end{itemize}

For this part, we're measuring a DC voltage that moves between $~0.6
    \si{\volt}$ and $~2.4 \si{\volt}$ at a slow rate : It takes near $1
    \si{\second}$ to change from $0.6 \si{\volt}$ to $2.4 \si{\volt}$. For the
second part, we're measuring a static DC voltage, just to ensure the battery is
present and in it's operating range.

Since the voltages are already in our measurement range, and even more, in the
area where the integrated ADC is quite linear, we don't have a lot of signal
conditioning to do.

We've only designed a filter to remove any high frequency signals that may be
picked by the wires used. Thus, we designed a Sallen-Key active filter, with a
100 Hz cutoff frequency. This filter is absent from the power supply rail
measurements, since they are located on the PCB, and we can ensure the signal
integrity with a proper layout.

The circuit is the following one : \input{\Schematics/servo-filter.tex}

Using a SPICE simulator, we got this response :

The response match our needs, which are quite simple : Remove the potential
harmfull noise, and fast variations that could occur.

The real circuit on the schematic is based on this one, but with optional
configurations jumpers to enable tuning the circuit on board.

This include :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   An optionnal voltage divider at the input, to avoid putting the OpAmp in
          overvoltage.
    \item   Optionals jumpers to bypass the frontend directly to the ADC.
\end{itemize}
