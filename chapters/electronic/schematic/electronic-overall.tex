\section{Schematic presentation}
Since the project can be quite complex, we've done a schematic based on hierarchical sheets.
This enable us to sort the different parts of the schematic, and even duplicate some of them easily !

This is done in Altium by placing subsheets and linking them through ports and power nets.

\subsection{First page}
On the first page, we found the top of the schematic, and it look like a functionnal diagram !
We have placed blocks for the microcontroller, the sensors, and others IO.

There also power input with they're associated protections :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   2A slow-blow fuse, to prevent any overload of the batteries and short-circuits.
    \item   Reverse protection diode. Prevent damages if the supply is wired backward.
\end{itemize}

The whole schematic is available in annexes of this document as reference.
