\section{Power section}
Now, let's look into the power section of the board. This is this section responsible to
power up the heaviest devices, which can't be powered from a GPIO.

There's few devices on the board that require specific circuits to be driven :

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item   The servos engines (wings and parachute).
    \item   The buzzer.
    \item   The engines starters.
\end{itemize}

Each of theses elements go it's solution since they're requirements aren't the same.

\subsection{Servo engines}
Theses devices are already an integrated solution, we don't directly drive the engine.
So, they're power requirements are quite easy to fulfill : We feed them with 5V, stable 
voltage. 

We only used bulk capacitors near they're connectors to ensure, even if a current peak 
occurs to handle it locally.

\subsection{Buzzer}
This second device is a different beast, since we drive it directly. This time, we placed 
it directly on the supply, with an NMOS on the low side, to switch on or off the current 
on it, and thus make sound, or not.

So, we needed an NMOS transistor to be choosen that can handle some current, but more 
importantly : An NMOS that was compatible with our voltage level available on the output 
of GPIOS\footnote{
    The mosfet we choosed was working, the can be optimized : We didn't make sure that is 
    was fully switched at our GPIO voltage level, and thats effectively the case : It fully 
    switch at arround 6V. Thus, the current is limited, which is fine for logic usages but
    not power ones.
}.

\subsection{Engines starters}
For theses last one, that's where the requirements are the strongest : We need a lot of
current, arround 2A per engines to start, at a quite high voltage (8-9V). Thus, we needed
a solution.

Here we used ULN2803C drivers IC, made to handle a lot of current with difficults loads 
(inductives, high voltage...). Theses are Darlington BJT transistors pairs, with each 
channel done for 500mA. By using four channels in parallel, we got our current requirements.

But, theses IC They draw arround $ 1 \si{\milli\ampere}$ per input ! Here, that wasn't 
an issue since theses inputs are controlled by an AND gate \ref{subsec:dis_logic}. This 
gate is able to provide more than enough current, while preserving a low input current, 
perfect for an MCU or any GPIO.
