The first step when designing circuits is creating the schematic.
Since the design is mainly digital (theres only four analog signals), it
can be easily cutted down into differents blocks.

We're going to start with the analog design, for the inputs and voltage
rail measurements. Then, we'll quickly see the RF design. By after, we're
going to explain the power management on the board, and to finish some words
on the digital design.
