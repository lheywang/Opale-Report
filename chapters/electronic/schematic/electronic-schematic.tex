First, we're going to dig into the schematic we've done for the physical part
of controller. Thus, we're going to start with a global schematic part, where
we explain the organization of the pages, and then we'll dig a bit deeper into
the differents blocs.

The whole schematic is available at the end of this report, in the annexes
\ref{annex:schematic}.
