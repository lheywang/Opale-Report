\section{RF Antennas}
For this second section, we're going to explore some RF design steps that we done on the PCB,
to draw our antennas for the different modules.

This include a $1.55 \si{\giga\hertz}$ for the GPS signals, and a $2.4 \si{\giga\hertz}$
Bluetooth antenna.

For theses antenna, we've found a nice application note from TI \cite{InvertedF} that
show different examples of RF design for $2.4 \si{\giga\hertz}$  Antenna, and \cite{GNSS}
for the $1.55 \si{\giga\hertz}$ one. Since we don't really know how to properly design an
antenna from scratch, we copied theses design into our schematic and PCB while doing a
little bit of MATLAB simulation on the design to ensure the criterions will be matched.
