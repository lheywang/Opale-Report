\section{Parachute mechanism}
Once launched, the rocket need an safe method to land back on earth. This mean
we need a parachute to be deployed once the rocket has got it's maximal
altitude.

But, this parachute need to be safely stored inside on rocket tube while
launching, to prevent any damages !

\subsection{Constraints}
To ensure a correct flight trajectory, we needed to place the parachute (which
is a quite heavy element) near the center of the rocket. This mean there is
some stuff above it.

This is an serious constraint, because we can't simply eject the tip of the
rocket to free the parachute, but we need to split the tube in half, while
ensuring structural rigidity of the tube while launching !

\subsection{Solutions}
To circumvent these constraints, we choose a locking mechanism, based on a
rotational lock.

There is two rings, one fixed to the tube, the other fixed to an axle in the
middle of the rocket. These two are bound together by four locks, for which a
rotating movement of the base will make them rotate, exposing a solid arm to
the outside.

These arms are going into slots in the second part of the tube, where they lock
themselves into, maintaining the both part of the tube together.

A final spring has been added in the inferior part of the tube to ensure the
top part will be ejected once the locks are removed.
