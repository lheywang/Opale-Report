Now that we've seen the main physical part of our rocket as the PCB and the
physics in the chapter\ref{chap:electronic}. Let's go back to our
specifications. Our rocket needs to support up to 16g of acceleration, we need
to acquire the flight data and finally we need our rocket to be stabilized by 4
ailerons. We'll now talk about this last part. For a more efficient read about
this I'll present you with the plan that we will follow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The control theory behind controlling said ailerons and how to integrate those
          equations into simulation software
    \item The application and translation of those simulations to the software.
\end{itemize}

After those three axes we will finally conclude about the controller side of
the rocket.

To finish this introduction, you will see below a schematic of Opale. The
ailerons that we will control are the forwardmost ones. There are not many
reasons apart from the challenge to use such ailerons at the front of a micro
test rocket as the inherent stability of a rocket would be enough for most
rockets of this size. Those ailerons even reduce this stability by firstly
reducing the ratio CG/CL (center of gravity per center of lift, see the
mechanical appendix \ref{annex:mechanical} for more detail). The reason to add
such ailerons for our project is to first and foremost add the challenge and
complexity needed for this project to be worthy of being a TER and secondly in
the future, we could change the software to follow some sort of waypoints in
the air for the rocket to try and follow.
