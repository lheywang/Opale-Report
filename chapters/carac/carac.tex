One of the first steps on this project was to fetch the maximal amount of informations
about the different sensors and actuator we could.
Many of this data is given by the datasheet, and the work to validate is minor, but there 
is case where the datasheet don't provide enough data.
This force us to measure our proprer data.

We're using three elements in that situation : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The servo engines
    \item The wings
    \item The internal ADC of the MCU
\end{itemize}

Two of them are electrical devices and can easily be characterized.
We're now going to show some of this data :
