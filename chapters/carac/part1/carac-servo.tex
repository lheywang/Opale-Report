First, we need to measure precisely how the engines respond to any arbitrary
input, to design they're own control loop. To measure the servo response, we
proceeded in two times : A first session, with some electronic specialized
tool, and a second session with the MCU as controller and measuring unit !

\paragraph{}
We used this schematic for the measures : \input{data/circuitikz/servo-test}

\paragraph{}
For this measures, we sent to the servo a PWM signal at a frequency of $50
    \si{\hertz}$ and with a pulse length between $1 \si{ms}$ and $2 \si{ms}$. For
the first session, this PWM was generated with a signal generator, and for the
second, using an MCU.

The measure was done using both an oscilloscope and the ADC of the MCU.

We got these measures\footnote{ This came from the second session only. The
    measures for the first sessions didn't gave us proper results. } :

\paragraph{}
Using the zoom functions, we can identify that in our case, the servos engines
are responsing as a very simple device : A first order one.

They goes into the required position in about $1 Te$, which is on our system
arround $70 \si{\milli\second}$ by achieving a linear transition.
