First, we need to measure precisely how the engines respond to any arbitrary input, to design they're own control loop.
To measure the servo response, we proceeded in two times : A first session, with some electronic specialized tool,
and a second session with the MCU as controller and measuring unit !

\paragraph{}
We used this schematic for the measures :
\input{data/circuitikz/servo-test}

\paragraph{}
For the first session, we sent the control signal using a dedicated signal generator, configured
to output a PWM at a frequency of $50 \si{\hertz}$ and with a pulse length between $1 \si{ms}$ and
$2 \si{ms}$.
We measured the output of the servo engines, which is an analog output that reflect the servo position
using an oscilloscope, and a bit after using directly the ADC of the MCU.

We got theses measures :

Theses are way better than we got on the first session, because we addresses the issues.

Using the zoom functions, we can identify that in our case, the servos engines are responsing
as a very simple device : A first order one.

They goes into the required position in about $1 Te$, which is on our system arround
$120 \si{\milli\second}$ by achieving a linear transition.
