\section{Configuration using devicetrees}
Since we're using a microcontroller that is widely available, most of the work with 
devicetrees has already been done by the manufacturer.

Thus, we don't need to care about memory, cpus, or other internals details of the
peripherals. We only enable and configure the required peripherals.

\paragraph{}
To make the structure cleaner, we've used a lot of overlays, because it's much easier
to debug and find the right property when needed.
