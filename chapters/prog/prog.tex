For this part, let's talk about a whole different beast : The software. This correspond to all of the code executed
on the microcontroller to command all of the actions done, from the control of the rocket trajectory to the log of
the temperature !

\paragraph{}
This is a very complex topic, that could be the subject of a whole report, so we're forced to reduce some part of it.
Nonetheless, we'll go trough all of the main subjects.
First, we'll talk about the configuration of the different functions by exploring the different devicetree files.
In a second time, we'll go trough the fundamentals of Zephyr RTOS, which was used to schedule main tasks and handle
the nasty memory stuff for ourselves.
Then, we'll start to ramp up into the different abstraction layers used, from the drivers to the threads.
To conlude this chapter, we're going to show the global software architecture we used over the project.
